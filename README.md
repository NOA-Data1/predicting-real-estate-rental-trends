# Predicting Real Estate Rental Trends: A Deep Learning Approach

## 📖 Overview
This project implements advanced Deep Learning models (LSTM and RNN) to forecast price trends in the rental property market. Using historical data, the system identifies patterns and provides reliable projections for 24 and 48-month periods.

## 🧠 Technology Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow & Keras (LSTM & RNN architectures)
* **Data Processing:** Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Predictive Modeling:** Comparison between simple RNNs and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
- **Data Pipeline:** Includes scaling (StandardScaler), handling missing values, and time-series windowing.
- **Forecasting:** Strategic projections for 2 and 4 years to assist in real estate investment decisions.

## 📈 Results
The model successfully captured market volatility in the short term and identified a stabilization trend in the long-term 48-month forecast.
